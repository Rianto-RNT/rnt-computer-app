## Demonstration

### 1) User Authentication client side using firebase

- Home
  - Pagination
  - Select specific fields in result
  - Limit number of results
  - Filter by fields
- Login
  - email
  - Password
- Register
  - Email registration
- registration complete
  - Redirect link from firebase then you can completly login as a user/admin
- Forgot Password
  - User can reset password using Forgot password menu
  - Validation on update
- Header
  - Home menu
  - Login menu
  - Register menu
  - User and logout menu

### 2) Before We Start

- We have complete a first major section in client side
- However we want to use our node server with mongodb
- That means the firebase client-side implementation pretty much ends here
- we'll use firebase to only log the user and get token (authentication)

- In our backend we will validate thet token using firebase admin so that our App is well secure
- what i mean by secure is that if we dont check the validity of token in the backend then anyone can send anything as a token to get access to protected routes/resource

- Once we implement fire base in backend, when user register or login to our app, we will create or update user in mongodb

- then we will comeback to our login/register page and make some adjustments, so then when user login, the response is from our backend.
